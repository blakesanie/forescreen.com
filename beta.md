# Investivision - Beta Testing Plan

_Beginning week of June 1st, lasting â‰ˆ2 weeks_

### Thank you for chosing to participate in beta testing for [Investivision.com](http://www.investivision.com)!

## Purpose

The purpose of this beta testing program is to identify bugs, inconsistencies, and other flaws across various platforms (OS, mobile, browser, etc) with the end goal of creating a seamless UX for all users.

## Communication

All communications will be housed inside [this Slack workspace](https://investivisionbeta.slack.com). I will send general messages to the **#general** channel. Each testing group will have its own respective channel: **#groupone** and **#grouptwo**.

## Participation

Testers are encouraged to post _in their group's Slack channel_ about **bizarre behavior** or **bugs** they've encountered or **any potential improvement** they suggest. **Every morning, I will post a daily task in each group's channel**. I will be answering any questions or addressing any confusion along the way.

Each daily testing task should only take a matter of minutes!

<h4 style="color: rgba(190,0,0);"> Please do not explore the service beyond the current and previous instructions. If you run into a roadblock, let me know in your group's Slack channel, and the issue will be addressed.</h4>

## Groups

Testers are divided into two groups. Each group will be asked to test the same features, but perhaps at different times or in a different way.

## Testing Payments

Since this is a paid service, we will be testing the underlying payment system. I configured the subscription to have the **minimum recurring cost of $0.50 per week**. During the first week, this payment will be made to begin your subscription. At the start of the second week, (I expect that) your payment method on file will be charged another $0.50 to renew your subscription. Finally, at the end of the second week, I will be asking you to unsubscribe, and no more payments will be made.
