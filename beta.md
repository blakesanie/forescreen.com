# Investivision.com - Beta Testing Plan

_June 1st - June 12th_

## Purpose

The purpose of this beta testing program is to identify bugs, inconsistencies, and other flaws across various platforms (OS, mobile, browser, etc) with the end goal of creating a seamless UX for all users.

## Communication

All communications will be housed inside [this Slack workspace](https://www.forescreencom-d1l1989.slack.com). I will send general messages to the #general channel. Each testing group will have its own respective channel: #groupone and #grouptwo.

## Participation

Testers are encouraged to post _in their group's Slack channel_ about **bizarre behavior** or **bugs** they've noticed or **any potential improvement** they identify.

## Groups

Testers are divided into two groups. Each group will be asked to test the same features, but perhaps at different times or in a different way.
